## TALKIE

TALKIE is an app where parents of bilingual children can find other families who speak the same language as they do and then they can set up a playdate.

Playdate can help your child to maintain and improve language skills and a huge plus of it it's fun :sunglasses:

Moreover this app has its own chat :wink:

This app can solve a few problems at once:
* motivate kids to use minor language more often
* practice language skills
* have a good time
* and make new friends 

## Technologies and concepts I used in this project
* ReactJs
* Redux
* Express
* REST API
* Sequelize as ORM
* One-to-many and many-to-many models
* Firebase :tulip:
* React-select as multiselect :tulip:
* Bootstrap :tulip:
* Material-UI :tulip:

:tulip: *New technologies learnt during this project*

## Goals for this project

The goal of this project is to build fullstack app, practicing and learning new technologies.
I learnt these new tools on my own by reading documentation, reading articles and watching tutorials.

* practice full-stack app development
* build a working prototype in 2 weeks
* apply skills which we learnt during Codaisseur bootcamp
* explore new technology single-handedly
* showcase and document development skills using:
    - make a wireframe
    - design a data model
    - write user stories
    - use git flow
   
## User Story

* As a user I want to set up a playdate for my kid.
* As a user I want to be able to create an account.
* As a user I want to add as many languages as we speak.
* As a user I want to specify different age of my children.
* As a user I want to find families who speak the same language as we do.
* As a user I want to be able to connect to other users.
*planned* As a user I want to find families who live near us.
*planned* As a user I want to find families who have kids of the same age as mine.

Some of the features are still in progress (and I already have some new ideas in mind :grin:).
